Brief description of design:
- ViewServer
  - Start by assigning the first and second servers to ping to be the primary and secondary.
  - periodicly check for alive servers with onPingCheckTimer
    - adjust view if either primary or secondary are dead in the cycle (and only when the current primary already acknowledge the current view)
- PBClient
  - periodicly check for the correct view from the view server
  - To run command, it sends the command to the primary and wait until the primary to reply (or there is a change in view then resends the command to the new primary)
- PBServer
  - primary:
    - receive a command from clients
        -> forward (using timer) to backup to run
        -> once receive the confirmation from the backup, execute the command and reply back to the client.
    - when the backup is changed, transfer it current state (whole application) to the new backup (using timer).
    - do not accept any new command when in the process of transferring (wait for the backup to confirm that the transfer is done).
    - do not accept any new command when in the process of forwarding a command to the backup (wait for the confirmation from the backup).
    - while transferring, do not acknowledge the view server that it knows about the current view (ping with old view number) to ensure that view does not change again.
  - backup:
    - on start, wait for the primary to transfer the state, and reply with accept message that transferring is done.
    - do not accept any request from clients.
    - receive forwarding request from the primary and reply back for the confirmation that backup's state is updated.
