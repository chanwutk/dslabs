Brief description of design:
- PaxosClient
  - To run command, it broadcast the command to all of the servers in the list.
- PaxosServer
  - If leader is not active, on timer elect the new leader by broadcasting their
      promised ballot number, when the majority of servers accept the leader with
      the highest ballot number, it will continue to the next phrase.
  - If active, periodically broadcast message to other servers for updating
    paxos log, sequential executing, and garbage collecting. Then servers send
    the latest execute slot number back to leader for update garbage collect target.
    When leader ping other server, it will be considered as active, otherwise other
    servers will think it is dead and begin to elect a new leader.
  - When client send a new request, leader will keep track and put it on the paxos log.
    Then broadcast a new message proposing the new operation to other servers. After
    accepting the operation, each server will broadcast another message to other servers
    and when majority of servers accept the operation it will send the decision back to the
    leader and try to execute a chosen command in the log.
