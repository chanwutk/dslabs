Brief description of design:
- part 1:
  - rebalancing: to rebalancing all the group, take a shard from the group that is
    responsible for the highest number of shards to the group that is responsible for the
    lowest number of shards. Repeat until the group that is responsible for the highest number
    of shards and the group that is responsible for the lowest number of shards has difference
    in number of shards less than or equal to 1.
  - join: add new group being responsible for 0 shard. Then, rebalance.
  - leave: remove the group. Transfer all the shard to the group that is responsible for
    the highest number of shards. Then, rebalance.
  - move: move the shard.
  - query: return the config.
- part 2:
  - server and client do not use timer to query config to master.
    - client: query when rejected from server
    - server:
      - init
      - new request
      - reconfiguration finished
      - received a config from master
  - each server keeps a collection of applications, where each app contains kv of one shard.
    - when reconfiguration, send the whole application of the shard.
  - every received message goes to paxos for replication before actual execution
  - request: execute like normal
  - new config:
    - if first config: initialize all the application of all the shards.
    - else: send shards to the correct group
  - received shard: if correct config, ack to the sender
  - received ack: remove the application of the sent shard.
