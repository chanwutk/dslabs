Brief description of design:
- part 1:
  - rebalancing: to rebalancing all the group, take a shard from the group that is
    responsible for the highest number of shards to the group that is responsible for the
    lowest number of shards. Repeat until the group that is responsible for the highest number
    of shards and the group that is responsible for the lowest number of shards has difference
    in number of shards less than or equal to 1.
  - join: add new group being responsible for 0 shard. Then, rebalance.
  - leave: remove the group. Transfer all the shard to the group that is responsible for
    the highest number of shards. Then, rebalance.
  - move: move the shard.
  - query: return the config.
